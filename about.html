          <p class="card-text">An orphanage (also children's home) is a residential institution devoted to the care of orphans - children whose natural parents are deceased or otherwise unable or unwilling to care for them. Natural parents, and sometimes natural grandparents, are legally responsible for supporting children, but in the absence of these or other relatives willing to care for the children, they become a ward of the state, and orphanages are one way of providing for their care, housing and education.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Bal Niketan is a "Home" for orphan, destitute and abandoned children from Haryana and adjoining areas and was established on 2nd of October, 1983. It was the brainchild of its Founder President late Shri J.D. Sharma IAS (retd.) who was an eminent educationist and a former Vice Chancellor of Jammu University. Inspired by the words of Swami Vivekananda, "They Alone Live Who Live for Others", late Shri Sharma conceived the noble idea of establishing this "HOME" to help such children to grow and live with dignity as good citizens and ultimately to stand on their own feet through education and vocational training arranged by Bal Niketan.

                It is located in Sector-2, Panchkula on 1.5 acre plot with a covered area of over 12,000 sq.ft. and having a strength of around 55 children.
